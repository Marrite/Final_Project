What was happening in 1900?
In 1898, Spanish-American War took place. In this war, USA defeated Spain and took over the control of many former Spanish colonies, including the Philippines. Filipino revolutionaries and soldiers had fought alongside American soldiers in the war against Spain.

So when the war ended and USA became the new colonial ruler of the Philippines, the Filipino troops felt betrayed. This ultimately led to a war between the Filipino troops and USA, known as the Philippine-American War. The war started in February, 1899 and was still going on in 1900. Background of the Battle of Pulang Lupa
In September, 1900, the American army decided to confront the Filipino revolutionaries and troops present in Marinduque. Marinduque is an island province of the Philippines. A group of American soldiers started the search operation on September 11, 1900.
