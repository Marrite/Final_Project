         Balimbing is a barangay in the municipality of Boac, in the province of Marinduque,It has 7 purok.Site of Labanan sa Paye is the famous event   ,July 31 of every year is hereby declared a special nonworking holiday in the entire Province of Marinduque to commemorate the victory of Filipino revolutionists in the Battle of Paye that took place on July 31, 1900.The site of encounter between Filipino Revolutionary Forces and American soldiers during the Filipino-American War.Our Baranggay is also known for having many fun events held every year. The Fighting
On September 13, 1900, the group of American soldiers started climbing a ridge while still searching for Abad and his men. Unknown to the Americans, Abad and his troops were positioned on the top of the ridge. As the American soldiers drew near, they opened fire. Americans took cover and responded by rifle fire.

This lasted for many hours but in the meanwhile, the bolomen of Abad’s army started surrounding the Americans. This forced the Americans to retreat. Even during their retreat, Abad and his men continued to follow them. The American soldiers were finally forced to take refuge in a rice field where they were surrounded on all sides. This forced Captain Devereux Shields to raise a white flag and surrender to Abad’s army.

Result and Aftermath
The battle was a significant victory for the Filipino troops. The American troops suffered 4 deaths while the rest of the 50 soldiers were taken captive. Abad and his troops suffered an unknown number of casualties. Although the Filipino troops won, the victory proved disastrous.

Soon American government retaliated by forcing all civilians of the island into towns and destroying food and shelter so that Abad may find no support. The American soldiers taken captive were ultimately freed through negotiations. The civilian population eventually stopped supporting Abad. This finally forced Abad to surrender to the U.S. army in April, 1901.
